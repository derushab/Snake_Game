I was able to make this game hw by applying what I learned from the class demos and this awesome YouTube tutorial by  Zigurous: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8gUnpeaMbQ

Game Theme:

As a baby snake move around to eat apples that randomly appear in different spots.

How to Play:

-Use arrow keys to move player (snake/green square).

-Move around to have the snake eat an apple (food/red square) that will randomly appear on screen. 

-Everytime you eat an apple, your body will grow. 

-If you crash into your growing body or the walls, then the game is over and it will restart back to when you were a small baby snake.
